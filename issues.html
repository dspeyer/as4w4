        <h1>Ann Speyer on the Issues</h1>

        <h2 id="schools">Our Schools Need Support</h2>
        
        <p>As a teacher for 30 years, 22 of them in New Britain public schools, I know about the school district.  It is made up of 10,000 students – diverse, determined and caring about one another.  It is made up of hard working, well qualified staff – teachers, aides and others.  But over the past 10 years it has been terribly underfunded.  Many budget years passed with no increase at all to meet the increases in cost of living expenses, heating, electricity, insurance, supplies. By now New Britain comes in next to last among all the school districts in the state when it comes to funding our students.  This must change!</p>
<p>We need to work to build up our small business economy so that the cost does not just fall on property owners.  We need to continue to work with our state legislators, increasing New Britain’s share of state education grants.  We need to seek out what savings there are to be found by consolidating some purchases and services with other towns.  City Hall and the School District also need to work together to save what they can by consolidation. We also need take another look at our city budget and reconsider our priorities.  The education of 10,000 New Britain children should be at the top!</p> 

        <h2 id="economy">Our Economy Needs Growth</h2>

        <p>New Britain’s economy is ready to rise.  We are well situated in the center of Connecticut. We are well linked to transportation via highways, Fastrack, CT Rail, Amtrak and traditional bus companies.  Our infrastructure provides excellent internet, cell service, electricity and water.  We have empty buildings that can be converted to 21st century spaces, empty land and comparatively affordable office space.</p>
        <p>Our city is home to a variety of entertainment venues.  We have theaters, concerts, museums and galleries, both downtown <div class=picturebox><a href="mtg with Hayes (2).jpg"><img src="mtg with Hayes (2).jpg" width=240 height=160></a>Meeting with Congresswoman Jahana Hayes and members of the Little Poland community</div> <p>and at CCSU. We are already known for our great diversity of ethnic restaurants.  We need to grow an awareness of these wonderful opportunities and draw visitors into New Britain.  Many cities have thrived on their arts communities; with proper publicity about what we have and how easy it is to get here, we could grow our entertainment economy.</p>
        <p>The role of the Common Council is to work cooperatively with developers who come asking to be part of New Britain, watching out both for quality of life in the neighborhoods and building the economy.  As a Council member, I will be in frequent communication with our state legislators and Congressional representatives as to state and federal grants and programs that can be of benefit to us.  I am also part of the public/private Martin Luther King Corridors Initiative, that offers support of small business development in areas of New Britain, including Ward 4.  I would like to gather community input as to the use of Transit Oriented District funding (Fastrack) which could be used to upgrade and develop the commercial areas along the northern part of East Street.</p>
        <p>It is critical to repair New Britain’s economy.  It is necessary in order to rebuild our support of education, maintain our city services, maintain our parklands, keep our homeowners here, our rental properties in good repair and raise our home values, be able to offer more tax relief to qualifying seniors.   I hope to bring my 40 years’ experience of living and working in New Britain to the Council to help with this mission.</p>
       
        <h2 id="neigborhoods">Our Neighborhoods Need Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Sidewalks: Sidewalk repair is a problem in New Britain.  While downtown is seeing lots of new brickwork sidewalks, the sidewalks in other parts of the city can be treacherous due to disrepair.  We need to divert some of our infrastructure spending to create a program of sidewalk maintenance by the city.  It is time that we move from only supporting street repair for cars; it’s time to add sidewalk repair for walkers</p>


        <h2 id="seniors">The Greening of New Britain and Keeping our Watershed</h2>

<p>Our environment supports us and as a Common Council member, I will be looking for ways to support our environment.</p>
        <p>Our water supply is perhaps our greatest asset.  It needs to remain so.  I was involved in protecting the Patton Brook Well and Burlington watershed from sale as well as the Shuttle Meadow Reservoir from Tilcon’s mining proposal.  I will continue this advocacy if there is any further threat to our watershed and supply system.</p>
        <p>I would support projects which advance New Britain’s use of solar power, especially in partially powering its schools and other public buildings. This is already being done at NBHS and should be considered in the planning of any other school or city building project.</p>
        <p>Many of New Britain’s tree lined streets have lost their trees due to age or destructive cutting by the electric company.  Tree lined streets clean the air, add cooling to a city and increase neighborhood value.  I would like to see a program of street tree planting with appropriate urban trees.  In residential neighborhoods, home owners would be asked to partner with the city by taking care of watering the saplings through their first season.</p>
        <p>I was an early advocate of banning plastic bags and will support the move toward reusable bags.</p>
        <p>I would like the Common Council to investigate a composting collection program for both household compost and yard waste.  Presently we pay to have these waste items carted and burned at the Bristol Resource Waste Recovery facility. They could be collected for compost, which would then be available at low cost for sale to residents.   Could there be savings benefit and environmental benefit to developing a composting program as have other towns?  Should this be done with our neighboring towns? We should explore the possibilities.</p>
        <p>Our parklands need to be preserved.  My goal on the Council will be to support a good blend of developed space such as water pads, ball fields, trails and paved walkways and undeveloped natural, open spaces.</p>
