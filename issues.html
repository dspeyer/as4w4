        <h1>Ann Speyer on the Issues</h1>

        <h2 id="schools">Our Schools Need Support</h2>
        
        <p>As a teacher for 30 years, 22 of them in New Britain public schools, I know about the school district.  It is made up of 10,000 students – diverse, determined and caring about one another.  It is made up of hard working, well qualified staff – teachers, aides and others.  But over the past 10 years it has been terribly underfunded.  Many budget years passed with no increase at all to meet the increases in cost of living expenses, heating, electricity, insurance, supplies. By now New Britain comes in next to last among all the school districts in the state when it comes to funding our students.  This must change!</p>
<p>We need to work to build up our small business economy so that the cost does not just fall on property owners.  We need to continue to work with our state legislators, increasing New Britain’s share of state education grants.  We need to seek out what savings there are to be found by consolidating some purchases and services with other towns.  City Hall and the School District also need to work together to save what they can by consolidation. We also need take another look at our city budget and reconsider our priorities.  The education of 10,000 New Britain children should be at the top!</p> 

        <h2 id="economy">Our Economy Needs Growth</h2>

        <p>New Britain’s economy is ready to rise.  We are well situated in the center of Connecticut. We are well linked to transportation via highways, Fastrack, CT Rail, Amtrak and traditional bus companies.  Our infrastructure provides excellent internet, cell service, electricity and water.  We have empty buildings that can be converted to 21st century spaces, empty land and comparatively affordable office space.</p>
        <p>Our city is home to a variety of entertainment venues.  We have theaters, concerts, museums and galleries, both downtown and at CCSU. We are already known for our great diversity of ethnic restaurants.  We need to grow an awareness of these wonderful opportunities and draw visitors into New Britain.  Many cities have thrived on their arts communities; with proper publicity about what we have and how easy it is to get here, we could grow our entertainment economy.</p>
        <p>The role of the Common Council is to work cooperatively with developers who come asking to be part of New Britain, watching out both for quality of life in the neighborhoods and building the economy.  As a Council member, I will be in frequent communication with our state legislators and Congressional representatives as to state and federal grants and programs that can be of benefit to us.  I am also part of the public/private Martin Luther King Corridors Initiative, that offers support of small business development in areas of New Britain, including Ward 4.  I would like to gather community input as to the use of Transit Oriented District funding (Fastrack) which could be used to upgrade and develop the commercial areas along the northern part of East Street.</p>
        <p>It is critical to repair New Britain’s economy.  It is necessary in order to rebuild our support of education, maintain our city services, maintain our parklands, keep our homeowners here, our rental properties in good repair and raise our home values, be able to offer more tax relief to qualifying seniors.   I hope to bring my 40 years’ experience of living and working in New Britain to the Council to help with this mission.</p>
