        <h2 id="educator">As an Educator</h2>

        <p> Of my 30 years as a public school music teacher, 22 of them were in the New Britain schools. I was priviledged to work with students from Slade, Roosevelt, Pulaski, HALS, Smalley, Jefferson, Chamberlain and Vance. Summers were spent teaching at the New Britain Summer Music Workshop.  As their string instrument teacher, I was able to get to know my students and their families well.  Strong, caring and determined, they taught me what New Britain is all about. </p>
