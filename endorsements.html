        <p><b>From former State Senator Terry Gerratana:</p></b>
<p>Voters in the 4th ward of New Britain have an opportunity to elect an excellent candidate to represent them on the Common Council. 
Ann Speyer is the candidate running to represent her neighborhood and the area where she and her husband have owned a home since 1978.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve known Ann for many decades, our sons went to school together, and especially through our volunteer work with the League of Women Voters, New Britain Area. Ann served as a President of the League as well as in other offices. She is an advocate for better local policy affecting us and affecting our children; education funding and a clean environment receive the most attention. She is a former schoolteacher in our city and is an active member of the Town-Gown committee in the 4th. She is a former member of the School Building Committee and presently serves on the Board of Directors of the New Britain Public Library.</p>
            <p>Ann will bring integrity, concern and her considerable wisdom to serve the people of the 4th.</p>
    <p><b>From former Supt. of Schools Ron Jakubowski:</b></p>
       <p>I have worked closely with Ann Speyer for decades on issues that are important in our community. She is a leader in New Britain already and will make a great Council Member.</p> <p>She is thoughtful, dedicated and tenacious in her advocacy for her neighborhood.</p>
